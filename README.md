Hello, my name is Ezequiel, a boy born in the Dominican Republic and currently living in Spain. My main interests in technology is the development of USEFUL and PRACTICAL applications for mobile. I never stop learning, I consider it a virtue and at the same time a problem because you can put things aside and you can never monopolize everything, it is something I am working on. I am currently learning React and troubleshooting with Python.

I do not have contact forms for now. "Technology brings us closer to those who are far away while separating us from those at home."
